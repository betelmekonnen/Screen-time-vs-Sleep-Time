# Screen-time-vs-Sleep-Time

In this project, I am looking to answer the question “Does screen time affect the amount and
quality of sleep people get?”. The quantitative variables I have used are Age, Screen Time, and
Sleep hours. So to clarify, I collected each participant's age, the average number of hours they
spent on their phones per week, and the average number of hours they slept per night. For my
qualitative variable, I collected each participant's Gender, primary phone activity, their most used
app, and their sleep quality. For Gender, primary phone activity, and sleep quality, I categorized
them in the survey and gave them options. For “Gender: I provided the categories: “Male”,
“Female”, and “Non-binary/other”. For primary phone activity, I had “Socials”, “Messaging”,
“Work/study”, “Streaming”, and “other”. And finally for sleep quality, I had them rate their
quality of sleep using “Very good”, “Good”, and “Fair”
